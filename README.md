# LibraryImprovedMonocularDepthEstimation
Final Project for UMD MSML 640 2024, original project was planned to use youtube 8M features, 
but current approach will rely more on existing stereoscopic libraries.


Main.py will run the evaluation of the model against the KITTI scene_data_flow test disparities 
which are generated by the created by the create_test_disp.py if they aren't present.

Train.py will train the current model on the KITTI data, however it saves the weights to the same directory when done
so if you would like to check the model's weight creation and accuracy at 0.79, it will need the weights to be deleted
and retrained.
